In short, they're tools for secure communication over insecure channels. You got that? It's like sending encrypted messages or passwords.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of it like trying to sneak a peek at someone's private thoughts while hiding behind the couch. Cryptography is like having superpower binoculars with secret peepholes in the darkness of encryption. You can hide your true intentions and make people trust you without arousing suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, that's all I've got for this discussion. Don't come crying to me if someone tries to bug you while we're talking; it's not my problem...\""
